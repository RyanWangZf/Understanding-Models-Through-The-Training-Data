# "Understanding Models Through The Training Data"

In this repository, we replicated some of the experiments discussed in Koh et al's paper titled "[Understanding Black-box Predictions via Influence Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04730)". The original code can be found here: http://bit.ly/gt-influence.

We focused on two use cases of influence functions discussed in the paper:
1. Understanding model behavior
2. Debugging domain mismatch

For each task, we replicated the results presented in the paper and implemented additional experiments using other datasets or other models. For a more detailed description of our work and our findings, kindly refer to the [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eGTzFUyIS1SgE-2AWvOoOg5VU1kDTd2G/view?usp=sharing).
